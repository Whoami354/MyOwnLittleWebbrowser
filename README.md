# JavaFX Mini Web Browser
This project is a small web browser implemented using JavaFX. It was developed during my second semester of Computer Science as a learning project.

The browser is intentionally lightweight and focuses on basic web browsing functionality. It does not provide many advanced features, but it allows smooth and simple navigation through the internet. The goal of this project was to better understand JavaFX, UI development, and the basics of embedding web content in a desktop application.

This project is meant for educational purposes and as a demonstration of fundamental JavaFX skills.
